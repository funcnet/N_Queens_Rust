N (aka Eight) Queens Solution in Rust

There are several versions Rust solution on web already for the N Queens puzzle. However, I find that those versions are much slower than Go version (refer to https://github.com/funcnet/n_queens_go), especially when N is larger than 10. So I created this Rust version. Per my tests, this version is as fast as the Go version.
